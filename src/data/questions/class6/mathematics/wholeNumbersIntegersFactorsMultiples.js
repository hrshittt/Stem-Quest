    question: "What is the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of 8 and 12?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["2", "4", "6", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation: "The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The highest common factor is 4."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of 4 and 6?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["12", "18", "24", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "12",
    explanation: "The multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16... The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18... The lowest common multiple is 12."

    question: "What is the sum of the first 5 whole numbers?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["10", "15", "20", "25"],
    correctAnswer: "10",
    explanation: "The first 5 whole numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Their sum is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10."
