    question: "If 2 pens cost ₹10, how much do 6 pens cost?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["₹20", "₹30", "₹25", "₹35"],
    correctAnswer: "₹30",
    explanation: "2 pens = ₹10, so 1 pen = ₹5. Therefore, 6 pens = 6 × ₹5 = ₹30"

    question: "What is the ratio of 15 minutes to 1 hour?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["15:1", "1:4", "15:60", "1:15"],
    correctAnswer: "1:4",
    explanation: "1 hour = 60 minutes. So 15:60 = 1:4 (simplified by dividing both by 15)"

  {
    question: "If 3:4 = x:12, what is the value of x?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["8", "9", "10", "16"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation: "3:4 = x:12. Cross multiplying: 3 × 12 = 4 × x, so 36 = 4x, therefore x = 9"

    question: "If a map scale is 1:1000, how many meters in real life does 5 cm on the map represent?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["50 meters", "500 meters", "5000 meters", "50000 meters"],
    correctAnswer: "50 meters",
    explanation: "1 cm on map = 1000 cm in real life. So 5 cm = 5 × 1000 cm = 5000 cm = 50 meters"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the ratio of 2/3 to 4/9?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["2:4", "3:2", "6:4", "1:2"],
    correctAnswer: "3:2",
    explanation: "(2/3):(4/9) = (2/3) ÷ (4/9) = (2/3) × (9/4) = 18/12 = 3/2 = 3:2"
