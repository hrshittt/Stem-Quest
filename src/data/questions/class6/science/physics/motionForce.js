    question: "What is the force that pulls objects toward the center of Earth?",
    options: ["Magnetism", "Gravity", "Friction", "Electricity"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Gravity is the force that pulls all objects toward the center of Earth."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an example of motion?",
    options: ["A book lying on a table", "A car moving on the road", "A tree standing still", "A rock on the ground"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Motion is the change in position of an object over time, like a moving car."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when you push a ball harder?",
    options: ["It moves slower", "It moves faster", "It doesn't move", "It changes color"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Applying more force makes the ball move faster."
  },
  {
    question: "What force opposes motion between two surfaces?",
    options: ["Gravity", "Friction", "Magnetism", "Electricity"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Friction is the force that opposes motion between surfaces in contact."
  },
  {
    question: "Which object will fall faster in a vacuum?",
    options: ["A feather", "A hammer", "Both fall at the same rate", "Neither will fall"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "In a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the unit of force?",
    options: ["Kilogram", "Newton", "Meter", "Second"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Force is measured in Newtons (N)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to a moving object if no force acts on it?",
    options: ["It stops immediately", "It continues moving at constant speed", "It speeds up", "It changes direction"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "According to Newton's first law, an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a force."
  },
  {
    question: "Which surface would have the least friction?",
    options: ["Rough sandpaper", "Smooth ice", "Carpet", "Grass"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Smooth ice has the least friction, making it slippery."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the force that keeps planets in orbit around the Sun?",
    options: ["Magnetism", "Gravity", "Friction", "Electricity"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Gravity keeps planets in their orbits around the Sun."
  },
  {
    question: "When you throw a ball upward, what happens to its speed?",
    options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same", "It becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "As the ball goes up, gravity slows it down until it stops and falls back."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the force that makes a compass needle point north?",
    options: ["Gravity", "Friction", "Magnetism", "Electricity"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Magnetic force makes the compass needle align with Earth's magnetic field."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is NOT a type of force?",
    options: ["Push", "Pull", "Color", "Gravity"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Color is a property of light, not a type of force."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when two forces act in opposite directions?",
    options: ["They add together", "They subtract from each other", "They multiply", "They divide"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Opposite forces subtract from each other, reducing the net force."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the force that makes a rubber band stretch?",
    options: ["Gravity", "Friction", "Elastic force", "Magnetic force"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Elastic force allows materials like rubber bands to stretch and return to their original shape."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an example of balanced forces?",
    options: ["A car accelerating", "A book at rest on a table", "A ball rolling down a hill", "A rocket launching"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "When a book is at rest on a table, the forces are balanced (gravity pulling down equals table pushing up)."
