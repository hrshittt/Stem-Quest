    question: "What is electric current?",
    options: ["Flow of water", "Flow of electrons", "Flow of air", "Flow of heat"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Electric current is the flow of electrons through a conductor."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the unit of electric current?",
    options: ["Volt", "Ampere", "Ohm", "Watt"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Electric current is measured in Amperes (A), named after André-Marie Ampère."
  },
  {
    question: "What is voltage?",
    options: ["Electric current", "Electric resistance", "Electric potential difference", "Electric power"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Voltage is the electric potential difference that causes current to flow."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the unit of voltage?",
    options: ["Ampere", "Volt", "Ohm", "Watt"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Voltage is measured in Volts (V), named after Alessandro Volta."
  },
  {
    question: "What is resistance?",
    options: ["Flow of electrons", "Opposition to current flow", "Electric potential", "Electric power"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the unit of resistance?",
    options: ["Volt", "Ampere", "Ohm", "Watt"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Resistance is measured in Ohms (Ω), named after Georg Simon Ohm."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Ohm's Law?",
    options: ["V = IR", "P = IV", "E = mc²", "F = ma"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Ohm's Law states that Voltage (V) equals Current (I) times Resistance (R)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to current when resistance increases?",
    options: ["Current increases", "Current decreases", "Current stays the same", "Current becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "According to Ohm's Law (V = IR), if resistance increases and voltage stays the same, current decreases."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a magnet?",
    options: ["A device that creates heat", "A device that creates light", "A device that creates magnetic field", "A device that creates sound"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "A magnet is a device that creates a magnetic field around it."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the ends of a magnet called?",
    options: ["Top and bottom", "Left and right", "North and south poles", "Positive and negative"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Magnets have north and south poles, where magnetic force is strongest."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when like poles of magnets are brought together?",
    options: ["They attract", "They repel", "They stick together", "Nothing happens"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Like poles (north-north or south-south) repel each other."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when unlike poles of magnets are brought together?",
    options: ["They attract", "They repel", "They cancel out", "Nothing happens"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Unlike poles (north-south) attract each other."
  },
  {
    question: "What is an electromagnet?",
    options: ["A permanent magnet", "A magnet created by electric current", "A natural magnet", "A broken magnet"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "An electromagnet is a magnet created by passing electric current through a coil of wire."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to an electromagnet when current is turned off?",
    options: ["It becomes stronger", "It becomes weaker", "It loses its magnetism", "It changes polarity"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "When current is turned off, an electromagnet loses its magnetic properties."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the relationship between electricity and magnetism?",
    options: ["They are unrelated", "They are the same thing", "They are closely related", "They oppose each other"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Electricity and magnetism are closely related phenomena that together form electromagnetism."
