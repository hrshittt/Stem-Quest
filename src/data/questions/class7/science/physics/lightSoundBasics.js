    options: ["A form of energy", "A type of matter", "A type of sound", "A type of heat"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Light is a form of electromagnetic energy that we can see."
  },
  {
    question: "How does light travel?",
    options: ["In curves", "In straight lines", "In circles", "In zigzags"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Light travels in straight lines until it hits an object or changes medium."
  },
  {
    question: "What is sound?",
    options: ["A form of light", "A form of energy", "A type of matter", "A type of heat"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Sound is a form of energy that travels as vibrations through matter."
  },
  {
    question: "How does sound travel?",
    options: ["Through empty space", "Through matter only", "Through light", "Through heat"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Sound needs matter (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel through."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when light hits a mirror?",
    options: ["It stops", "It gets absorbed", "It reflects", "It disappears"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Light reflects off mirrors, allowing us to see our reflection."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the speed of light?",
    options: ["300,000 km/s", "30,000 km/s", "3,000 km/s", "300 km/s"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Light travels at approximately 300,000 kilometers per second in a vacuum."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the speed of sound in air?",
    options: ["340 m/s", "34 m/s", "3,400 m/s", "34,000 m/s"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Sound travels at approximately 340 meters per second in air at room temperature."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when light passes through a prism?",
    options: ["It becomes white", "It splits into colors", "It becomes invisible", "It stops"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A prism splits white light into the colors of the rainbow (spectrum)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is an echo?",
    options: ["A type of light", "Reflected sound", "A type of heat", "A type of matter"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "An echo is sound that bounces back after hitting a surface."
  },
  {
    question: "What color has the longest wavelength?",
    options: ["Blue", "Green", "Red", "Yellow"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Red light has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum."
  },
  {
    question: "What color has the shortest wavelength?",
    options: ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Blue light has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum."
  },
  {
    question: "What is frequency in sound?",
    options: ["How loud it is", "How high or low it is", "How fast it travels", "How bright it is"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Frequency determines the pitch of sound - high frequency = high pitch."
  },
  {
    question: "What is amplitude in sound?",
    options: ["How high or low it is", "How loud it is", "How fast it travels", "How bright it is"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Amplitude determines the volume of sound - larger amplitude = louder sound."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to light when it enters water?",
    options: ["It stops", "It speeds up", "It slows down", "It disappears"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Light slows down when it enters denser materials like water."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a shadow?",
    options: ["A type of light", "An area where light is blocked", "A type of sound", "A type of heat"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A shadow is an area where light is blocked by an opaque object."
