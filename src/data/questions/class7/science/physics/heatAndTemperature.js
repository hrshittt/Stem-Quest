    question: 'Which method of heat transfer does NOT require a medium?',
    options: [
      'Conduction',
      'Convection',
      'Radiation',
      'All require a medium'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Radiation',
    explanation: 'Radiation is the only method of heat transfer that can occur in vacuum, like how heat from the Sun reaches Earth through space.',
    hints: [
      'Think about how heat from the Sun reaches Earth',
      'Which process can work through empty space?',
      'Both conduction and convection need matter to transfer heat'
    ]
  }
