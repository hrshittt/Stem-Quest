  {
    question: "What is temperature a measure of?",
    options: ["Heat energy", "Average kinetic energy of particles", "Total energy", "Volume"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance."
  },
  {
    question: "How does heat flow between objects?",
    options: ["From cold to hot", "From hot to cold", "It doesn't flow", "Randomly"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Heat always flows from hotter objects to colder objects."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to particles when a substance is heated?",
    options: ["They move slower", "They move faster", "They stop moving", "They change color"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "When heated, particles gain energy and move faster."
  },
  {
    question: "Which material is the best conductor of heat?",
    options: ["Wood", "Plastic", "Metal", "Rubber"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Metals are excellent conductors of heat because their electrons can move freely."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the process called when a liquid turns into a gas?",
    options: ["Freezing", "Melting", "Evaporation", "Condensation"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Evaporation is when a liquid turns into a gas at temperatures below boiling point."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to the volume of most substances when heated?",
    options: ["It decreases", "It increases", "It stays the same", "It becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Most substances expand when heated due to increased particle movement."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the freezing point of water in Celsius?",
    options: ["0°C", "32°C", "100°C", "-273°C"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C at standard pressure."
  },
  {
    question: "Which method of heat transfer occurs in fluids?",
    options: ["Conduction", "Convection", "Radiation", "Insulation"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Convection is heat transfer through the movement of fluids (liquids and gases)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the process called when a gas turns into a liquid?",
    options: ["Evaporation", "Boiling", "Condensation", "Freezing"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Condensation is when a gas turns into a liquid, like water droplets on a cold surface."
  },
  {
    question: "Which material is the best insulator of heat?",
    options: ["Copper", "Aluminum", "Styrofoam", "Steel"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Styrofoam is an excellent insulator because it traps air and prevents heat flow."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to the temperature during a phase change?",
    options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays constant", "It becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "During phase changes, temperature remains constant while energy is used to change the state."
  },
  {
    question: "Which method of heat transfer doesn't require a medium?",
    options: ["Conduction", "Convection", "Radiation", "Insulation"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Radiation can transfer heat through empty space, like heat from the Sun."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the boiling point of water in Celsius?",
    options: ["0°C", "32°C", "100°C", "212°C"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Water boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to the density of water when it freezes?",
    options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same", "It becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Water expands when it freezes, making ice less dense than liquid water."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an example of convection?",
    options: ["Touching a hot stove", "Feeling heat from a fire", "Hot air rising", "Heat from the Sun"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Hot air rising is an example of convection, where heated air moves upward."
