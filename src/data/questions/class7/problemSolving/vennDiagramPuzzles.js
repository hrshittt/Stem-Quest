    question: "In a Venn diagram, if Circle A represents 'Animals' and Circle B represents 'Birds', where would a penguin be placed?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["Only in Circle A", "Only in Circle B", "In the intersection of A and B", "Outside both circles"],
    correctAnswer: "In the intersection of A and B",
    explanation: "A penguin is both an animal (Circle A) and a bird (Circle B), so it belongs in the intersection of both circles."
  },
  {
    question: "If Circle A has 10 elements, Circle B has 8 elements, and the intersection has 3 elements, how many elements are in the union of A and B?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["15", "18", "21", "24"],
    correctAnswer: "15",
    explanation: "Union = A + B - intersection = 10 + 8 - 3 = 15 elements."
  },
  {
    question: "In a Venn diagram with three circles representing 'Red', 'Blue', and 'Green', where would a purple object be placed?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["In the intersection of Red and Blue", "In the intersection of all three", "Outside all circles", "In the Red circle only"],
    correctAnswer: "In the intersection of Red and Blue",
    explanation: "Purple is made by mixing red and blue, so it belongs in the intersection of the Red and Blue circles."
  },
  {
    question: "If 20 students like Math, 15 like Science, and 8 like both, how many students like only Math?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["7", "8", "12", "20"],
    correctAnswer: "12",
    explanation: "Students who like only Math = Total Math students - Students who like both = 20 - 8 = 12."

  {
    question: "In a Venn diagram, if Circle A represents 'Even numbers' and Circle B represents 'Numbers divisible by 3', where would the number 6 be placed?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["Only in Circle A", "Only in Circle B", "In the intersection of A and B", "Outside both circles"],
    correctAnswer: "In the intersection of A and B",
    explanation: "6 is both even (divisible by 2) and divisible by 3, so it belongs in the intersection of both circles."
  },
  {
    question: "If a class has 30 students, 18 play football, 12 play basketball, and 6 play both sports, how many students play neither sport?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["6", "8", "10", "12"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation: "Students playing at least one sport = 18 + 12 - 6 = 24. Students playing neither = 30 - 24 = 6."
  },
  {
    question: "In a Venn diagram with 'Mammals' and 'Flying animals', where would a bat be placed?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["Only in Mammals circle", "Only in Flying animals circle", "In the intersection", "Outside both circles"],
    correctAnswer: "In the intersection",
    explanation: "A bat is both a mammal and a flying animal, so it belongs in the intersection of both circles."
  },
  {
    question: "If Circle A has 5 elements, Circle B has 7 elements, and there are 2 elements in the intersection, how many elements are in Circle A only?",
    type: "mcq",
    options: ["2", "3", "5", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation: "Elements in Circle A only = Total in A - Elements in intersection = 5 - 2 = 3."
