    question: "What is the sum of angles in a triangle?",
    options: ["90°", "180°", "270°", "360°"],
    correctAnswer: "180°",
    explanation: "The sum of angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the measure of each angle in an equilateral triangle?",
    options: ["45°", "60°", "90°", "120°"],
    correctAnswer: "60°",
    explanation: "In an equilateral triangle, all angles are equal and sum to 180°. Therefore, each angle is 180° ÷ 3 = 60°."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these is NOT always true about an isosceles triangle?",
    options: ["Two sides are equal", "Two angles are equal", "All angles are equal", "Base angles are equal"],
    correctAnswer: "All angles are equal",
    explanation: "An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal angles, but not necessarily all angles equal (that would make it equilateral)."
  },
  {
    question: "When two lines intersect, the adjacent angles are:",
    options: ["Complementary", "Supplementary", "Equal", "None of these"],
    correctAnswer: "Supplementary",
    explanation: "When two lines intersect, adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they sum to 180°."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a right angle equal to?",
    options: ["45°", "60°", "90°", "180°"],
    correctAnswer: "90°",
    explanation: "A right angle measures exactly 90 degrees."
