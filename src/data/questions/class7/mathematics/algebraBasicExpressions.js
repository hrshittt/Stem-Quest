    question: "If x = 3, what is 2x + 5?",
    options: ["8", "11", "13", "16"],
    correctAnswer: "11",
    explanation: "When x = 3, substitute: 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these is an algebraic expression?",
    options: ["2 + 4 = 6", "3x + 5", "x = 7", "y > 10"],
    correctAnswer: "3x + 5",
    explanation: "An algebraic expression combines numbers and variables using mathematical operations. It does not include equal signs or inequalities."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the like terms in: 3x + 2y + 5x - 4y?",
    options: ["3x and 5x, 2y and -4y", "3x and 2y", "5x and -4y", "None of these"],
    correctAnswer: "3x and 5x, 2y and -4y",
    explanation: "Like terms have the same variables with the same exponents. Here 3x and 5x are like terms, and 2y and -4y are like terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Simplify: 3x + 5x",
    options: ["8x", "15x", "8xÂ²", "3x + 5x"],
    correctAnswer: "8x",
    explanation: "When adding like terms, we add their coefficients and keep the variable: 3x + 5x = 8x"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the coefficient in the term 7xy?",
    options: ["x", "y", "7", "xy"],
    correctAnswer: "7",
    explanation: "The coefficient is the numerical factor in a term. In 7xy, the coefficient is 7."
