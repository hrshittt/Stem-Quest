  {
    question: "What is pressure?",
    options: ["Force per unit area", "Force times area", "Force divided by volume", "Force plus area"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Pressure is force applied per unit area (P = F/A)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to pressure when area decreases?",
    options: ["Pressure increases", "Pressure decreases", "Pressure stays the same", "Pressure becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "When area decreases, pressure increases for the same force."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following has the highest pressure?",
    options: ["A person standing on both feet", "A person standing on one foot", "A person lying down", "A person sitting"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Standing on one foot concentrates the same weight over a smaller area, increasing pressure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the unit of pressure?",
    options: ["Newton", "Pascal", "Joule", "Watt"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Pressure is measured in Pascals (Pa) or Newtons per square meter."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do sharp knives cut better than dull ones?",
    options: ["They have more force", "They have less area", "They are heavier", "They are longer"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Sharp knives have a smaller cutting area, creating higher pressure for the same force."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to atmospheric pressure as you go higher?",
    options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same", "It becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude because there's less air above."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an example of high pressure?",
    options: ["A balloon", "A vacuum", "A hydraulic press", "A feather"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Hydraulic presses use high pressure to lift heavy objects."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to pressure in a liquid as depth increases?",
    options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same", "It becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Pressure in liquids increases with depth due to the weight of liquid above."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do snowshoes prevent sinking in snow?",
    options: ["They increase force", "They increase area", "They decrease weight", "They are warmer"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Snowshoes increase the area over which weight is distributed, reducing pressure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the pressure at sea level?",
    options: ["1 Pa", "101,325 Pa", "1000 Pa", "10 Pa"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 101,325 Pa."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following creates the most pressure?",
    options: ["100 N on 1 m²", "50 N on 0.5 m²", "200 N on 2 m²", "25 N on 0.25 m²"],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "25 N on 0.25 m² gives 100 Pa, which is the highest pressure among the options."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to pressure when force increases?",
    options: ["Pressure increases", "Pressure decreases", "Pressure stays the same", "Pressure becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "For the same area, increasing force increases pressure proportionally."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do deep-sea divers need special equipment?",
    options: ["Water is cold", "Water pressure is high", "Water is dark", "Water is salty"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Deep-sea divers face extremely high water pressure that can crush unprotected bodies."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the relationship between pressure and area?",
    options: ["Directly proportional", "Inversely proportional", "No relationship", "Exponentially related"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Pressure is inversely proportional to area - smaller area means higher pressure for the same force."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is NOT affected by pressure?",
    options: ["Cutting ability", "Lifting capacity", "Color of an object", "Depth measurement"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Color is a property of light and materials, not affected by pressure."
