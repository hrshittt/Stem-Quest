    type: "mcq",
    options: ["30", "36", "49", "64"],
    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation: "This is the sequence of perfect squares: 1², 2², 3², 4², 5², so the next is 6² = 36."

    type: "mcq",
    options: ["40", "42", "48", "56"],
    correctAnswer: "42",
    explanation: "This is n(n+1): 1×2=2, 2×3=6, 3×4=12, 4×5=20, 5×6=30, so next is 6×7=42."

    correctAnswer: "48",
    explanation: "This is n²-1: 2²-1=3, 3²-1=8, 4²-1=15, 5²-1=24, 6²-1=35, so next is 7²-1=48."

    correctAnswer: "160",
    explanation: "This sequence doubles each time: 5×2=10, 10×2=20, 20×2=40, 40×2=80, so next is 80×2=160."
