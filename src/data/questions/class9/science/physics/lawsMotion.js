    question: "What is Newton's First Law of Motion?",
    options: ["F = ma", "Objects at rest stay at rest", "Every action has an equal reaction", "Energy cannot be created"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Newton's First Law states that objects at rest stay at rest and objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Newton's Second Law of Motion?",
    options: ["F = ma", "Objects at rest stay at rest", "Every action has an equal reaction", "Energy is conserved"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Newton's Second Law states that Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Newton's Third Law of Motion?",
    options: ["F = ma", "Objects at rest stay at rest", "Every action has an equal reaction", "Energy cannot be destroyed"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to acceleration when force increases?",
    options: ["Acceleration increases", "Acceleration decreases", "Acceleration stays the same", "Acceleration becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "According to F = ma, if force increases and mass stays the same, acceleration increases."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to acceleration when mass increases?",
    options: ["Acceleration increases", "Acceleration decreases", "Acceleration stays the same", "Acceleration becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "According to F = ma, if mass increases and force stays the same, acceleration decreases."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an example of Newton's Third Law?",
    options: ["A car accelerating", "A book at rest", "A rocket launching", "A ball rolling"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "A rocket launching demonstrates action-reaction: the rocket pushes gas down, gas pushes rocket up."
  },
  {
    question: "What is inertia?",
    options: ["Force", "Acceleration", "Resistance to change in motion", "Speed"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion."
  },
  {
    question: "Which has more inertia: a bowling ball or a tennis ball?",
    options: ["Bowling ball", "Tennis ball", "They have the same inertia", "It depends on speed"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The bowling ball has more mass, so it has more inertia and resists changes in motion more."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the unit of force?",
    options: ["Kilogram", "Newton", "Meter", "Second"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Force is measured in Newtons (N), named after Sir Isaac Newton."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when you push against a wall?",
    options: ["Only you feel force", "Only the wall feels force", "Both you and wall feel equal force", "No force is involved"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "According to Newton's Third Law, when you push the wall, the wall pushes back with equal force."
  },
  {
    question: "What is momentum?",
    options: ["Mass times velocity", "Force times time", "Mass times acceleration", "Velocity times time"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Momentum (p) equals mass (m) times velocity (v): p = mv."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to momentum when velocity doubles?",
    options: ["Momentum doubles", "Momentum halves", "Momentum stays the same", "Momentum becomes zero"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Since momentum = mass Ã— velocity, doubling velocity doubles momentum."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following demonstrates Newton's First Law?",
    options: ["A car accelerating", "A book sliding to a stop", "A rocket launching", "A ball bouncing"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A book sliding to a stop shows inertia - it continues moving until friction stops it."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the relationship between force and acceleration?",
    options: ["Inversely proportional", "Directly proportional", "No relationship", "Exponentially related"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "According to F = ma, force and acceleration are directly proportional when mass is constant."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to a moving object in space with no forces acting on it?",
    options: ["It stops", "It slows down", "It continues at constant velocity", "It speeds up"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "In space with no forces, an object continues moving at constant velocity due to inertia."
